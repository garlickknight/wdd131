            <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
            <p>41 And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the
            commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out
            faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending
            happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p>

            <h2>Alma 34:33</h2>
            <p>33 And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not
            procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for
            eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can
            be no labor performed.</p>
