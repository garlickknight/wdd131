            <h2>About PT:</h2>
            <p>Physical therapy (PT), also known as physiotherapy, is a healthcare profession that focuses on the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of physical impairments, disabilities, and pain. Physical therapists (PTs) are trained healthcare professionals who work with patients to improve their mobility, function, and overall quality of life through various therapeutic techniques and exercises.</p>
            <p>Physical therapy can be beneficial for individuals of all ages and can address a wide range of conditions, including musculoskeletal injuries, neurological disorders, cardiovascular issues, respiratory problems, and post-surgical rehabilitation. PTs use a combination of manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, modalities (such as heat or cold therapy), and patient education to help patients recover from injuries, manage chronic conditions, and prevent future injuries.</p>
            <p>Physical therapy sessions typically involve an initial assessment to evaluate the patient's condition and develop a personalized treatment plan. The treatment plan may include exercises to improve strength, flexibility, balance, and coordination, as well as techniques to reduce pain and inflammation. PTs also provide guidance on proper body mechanics and ergonomics to help patients avoid further injury.</p>
            <p>Overall, physical therapy plays a crucial role in promoting health and wellness by helping individuals regain their independence and improve their physical function.</p>
